# Numpy-Tutorial

**NumPy Operations Notebook**

This notebook demonstrates various fundamental operations using NumPy, including array creation, reshaping, mathematical operations, and broadcasting. Key topics covered include:

1. **Array Creation and Manipulation**: Reshaping arrays, creating arrays of zeros and ones, and generating linearly spaced arrays.
2. **Basic Arithmetic and Aggregation**: Element-wise operations, summation, mean, max, and standard deviation.
3. **Slicing and Indexing**: Extracting subsets of arrays.
4. **Stacking and Concatenation**: Combining arrays using vertical and horizontal stacking, along with concatenation.
5. **Broadcasting**: Applying operations to arrays with different shapes using NumPy's broadcasting feature.
6. **Dot Products and Matrix Multiplications**: Performing dot products and matrix multiplication, and matrix inversion using `np.matmul()` and `inv()`.
7. **Array Copying and References**: Exploring how shallow and deep copying affect array manipulation.
